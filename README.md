# FIFA-Dataset_Excel_Cleaning

### About
I was thrilled to take part in a #datacleaningchallenge in the data-tech community that Promise Chinonso and other data enthusiasts organized in an effort to foster an atmosphere where novice, advanced, and professional data analysts could hone their data cleaning skills. 

The raw data file can be found [here](https://github.com/Monye-Okechukwu/FIFA-Dataset_Excel_Cleaning/blob/0e43fef8bf0bed895ebe29e43cb81c5488ca7ba9/FIFA21/fifa21_raw_data.csv) in the fifa21_raw_data.
The documentation and the steps I took in cleaning the data can be found [here](https://github.com/Monye-Okechukwu/FIFA-Dataset_Excel_Cleaning/blob/0e43fef8bf0bed895ebe29e43cb81c5488ca7ba9/FIFA21/Process.md) in the process.md fie.
The final outcome after the cleaning the dataset was in a new sheet and it can be found [here](https://github.com/Monye-Okechukwu/FIFA-Dataset_Excel_Cleaning/blob/0e43fef8bf0bed895ebe29e43cb81c5488ca7ba9/FIFA21/Fifa21_Cleaned.xlsx) in the Fifa21_cleaned fine.
